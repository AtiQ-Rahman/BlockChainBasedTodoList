1.diff between storage,calldata,stack,memory?
memory should be used when declaring variables (both function parameters as well as inside the logic of a function) that you want stored in memory (temporary), and calldata must be used when declaring an external function's dynamic parameters.

The easiest way to think about the difference is that calldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory.
